KNN 

Considered lazy clustering/classification algorithm. 

It holds on to complete training dataset and makes use of it to make predictions for unseen data.

When I initializse KNN classifier with K=5 then I say that when i pass you unforseen data then you need to consider 5 closest neibhors to this data in the training dataset and then get the class for max closest neibhors. 

The distance between the two datapoints are calculated by euclidean distance by default but can be changed as well.
